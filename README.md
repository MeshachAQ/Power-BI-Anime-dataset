# INTRO

Well anyone that knows me is well aware that I love anime. hahaha and so there was no way, I will be doing these projects without one of these. lol. I mean, but then this project was really fun as well. got to see the popularities of my favourites animes. it was great finding out I wasnt't the only anime fan.

Anyways, For this particular project, The source of my data was again kaggle and as always, I followed my hardcore stages in analysing a dataset. This dataset however is mainly power bi tool focused. let's jump in;

After downloading the data, I applied the step processes I normally employ in my projects.

### Data Cleaning & Transformation
### Data analyzing through dax measures
### Data visualization
### Recommendations

# Data Cleaning
Alot actually didn't go into this project in terms of data cleaning, the dataset was kinda okay to begin with so I only needed to go in create a new calendertable and connect the calender table to my dataset(particularly called data modelling)

# Data Analysis

With the Analysis. I leveraged dax measures to find the Averages and totals of the columns I looked at, I also looked at the top anime according to the dataset, build in some filters to navigate my dataset. There's a video link showing all this below

# Dashboard(Visualization)

My final dashboard looked something like this

Where I have my filters in the filter icon. To access them, one needs to hold down control and left click on the icon. To hide them, hold down control on the close button down on your left and left click on the mouse to hide, This was pretty fun but a short project for my favorite stuff, you know. lol

# Conclusion

This project was inspired by my love for anime. lol
